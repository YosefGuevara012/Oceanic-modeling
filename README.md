# Introduction to Physical Oceanography Report

Authors(Francisco Amor, Yosef Guevara)

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the study and analysis of physical oceanographic processes based on data collected from a series of boat trips and instrumental readings. The focus lies in understanding ocean currents, drifter trajectories, temperature, salinity profiles, and the physical modeling of marine environments.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**  
   An introduction to the study of physical oceanography, its approaches, and methodologies.

2. **Boat Trip**  
   2.1 **General Description** - Documentation of the boat trip, including objectives and methods.  
   2.2 **Boat Trip Stations** - Detailed information on the specific stations visited during the trip, including drifter and CTD station data.

3. **Drifter Trajectory Analysis**  
   Analysis of drifter paths over a three-day period, including the effects of wind and currents on drifter displacement.

4. **CTD Data Analysis**  
   Analysis of conductivity, temperature, and depth data gathered from various stations.

5. **Model Analysis**  
   Examination of the effectiveness of physical models such as Euler advection and Runge-Kutta methods in predicting drifter movement.

6. **Conclusions**  
In summary, the trajectory of objects in the water can be significantly affected by their geographical
location and the amount of drag they generate, depending on how submerged they
are. In general, it is evident that objects tend to have less displacement and are less affected
by wind and currents when more of their rigid body is underwater. The CDT data shows
that conductivity, temperature, and depth are affected by location, depth, and the surrounding
ocean conditions, as well as other physical and chemical properties of the water. However,
under controlled conditions in the same geographical area, these factors should remain similar.
To accurately understand the variations in salinity and temperature, it is necessary to consider
these factors and analyze the data in the context of these variables. Multiple factors can influence
the movement of drifters in the ocean, including ocean currents, wind, temperature,
salinity, and other physical and chemical properties of the water. External forces such as tides
and waves can also play a role. To understand the movement of drifters, models must take in
count all of these factors and by the size of the study area.

## Project Structure
The data and findings in this repository are presented through a comprehensive report and supported by graphical visualizations of boat trajectories, drifter paths, and CTD profiles.
