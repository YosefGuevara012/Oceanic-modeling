# Introduction to Physical Oceanography Report

Authors(Francisco Amor, Yosef Guevara)

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the study and analysis of physical oceanographic processes based on data collected from a series of boat trips and instrumental readings. The focus lies in understanding ocean currents, drifter trajectories, temperature, salinity profiles, and the physical modeling of marine environments.

## Contents
1. **Introduction**  
   An introduction to the study of physical oceanography, its approaches, and methodologies.

2. **Boat Trip**  
   2.1 **General Description** - Documentation of the boat trip, including objectives and methods.  
   2.2 **Boat Trip Stations** - Detailed information on the specific stations visited during the trip, including drifter and CTD station data.

3. **Drifter Trajectory Analysis**  
   Analysis of drifter paths over a three-day period, including the effects of wind and currents on drifter displacement.

4. **CTD Data Analysis**  
   Analysis of conductivity, temperature, and depth data gathered from various stations.

5. **Model Analysis**  
   Examination of the effectiveness of physical models such as Euler advection and Runge-Kutta methods in predicting drifter movement.

6. **Conclusions**  
   Summary of findings and implications for the study of physical oceanography.

## Project Structure
The data and findings in this repository are presented through a comprehensive report and supported by graphical visualizations of boat trajectories, drifter paths, and CTD profiles.

## How to Use
Researchers and students can utilize the data and analyses for educational purposes, to further study physical oceanography, or to enhance predictive oceanographic models.
